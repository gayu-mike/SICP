> Above all, I hope we don’t become missionaries. Don’t feel as if you’re Bible salesmen. The world has too many of those already.
> What you know about computing other people will learn. Don’t feel as if the key to successful computing is only in your hands.
> What’s in your hands, I think and hope, is intelligence:
> the ability to see the machine as more than when you were first led up to it, that you can make it more.”
